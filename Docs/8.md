# Build an image for a sample web application from a docker file using various docker file instructions

> To perform this experiment we will use https://labs.play-with-docker.com/
1. Once your session is active click on “Add New Instance”:

2. A new instance will start with a Docker Engine ready to accept commands

3. Next create/edit the Dockerfile. Run “vi Dockerfile”, press “i” to switch to “Insert Mode”, copy/paste the contents of our Dockerfile, press “Esc” to exit “Insert Mode”, and save+exit by typing “:x”

4. Build the new image using the command docker build <path>. Path refers to the directory containing the Dockerfile.

5. At the end of the process you should see the message “Successfully built <image ID>”

6. Start the new image and test connectivity to NGINX. Run the command 
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 <image ID>
```
>The option -p 80:80 exposes the Container port 80 as the Host port 80 to the world

7. As a result a port 80 link should have become active next to the IP. Click on it to access your NGINX service
